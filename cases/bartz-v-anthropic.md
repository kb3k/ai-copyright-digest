    <p>The core question is whether the use of copyrighted works to train AI models constitutes fair use. The court's ruling indicated that AI companies might train models on copyrighted works if the copies were obtained legally, but the broader implications of this ruling on transformative use and market harm remain disputed. Some sources suggest that the ruling opens a pathway for AI companies, while others argue it does not fully resolve the fair use debate. <span class="citation">[7]</span>, <span class="citation">[11]</span>, <span class="citation">[12]</span></p>

    <p>The question of whether AI companies can legally use copyrighted materials obtained from 'shadow libraries' like LibGen for training models is a critical unresolved issue. The plaintiffs alleged that Anthropic used pirated e-books, but the court's ruling on the legality of such sources remains ambiguous. <span class="citation">[6]</span>, <span class="citation">[11]</span>, <span class="citation">[12]</span></p>

    <h2>Possible Outcomes</h2>
    
<div class="outcome-card">
    <h3 class="outcome-card-title">Plaintiff wins - Anthropic found liable</h3>
    <div class="outcome-card-content">
        If the plaintiffs win against Anthropic for copyright infringement, it could set a significant precedent for AI training using copyrighted materials. The court's decision will likely focus on whether AI training is considered transformative use, a key aspect of fair use analysis [7, 11]. A ruling against Anthropic could result in damages potentially reaching billions, affecting AI companies that depend on large datasets [3, 12]. Additionally, the $1.5 billion settlement, with a quarter going to lawyers, raises concerns about fair compensation for creators, as individual authors may receive less than statutory maximums [2, 4]. This outcome could lead AI companies to implement stricter data governance and sourcing protocols to mitigate liability from shadow libraries [6, 19]. However, the broader implications for market harm and the adequacy of current copyright laws in the AI context remain unclear, as the ruling may not definitively address the legality of using materials from sources like LibGen [6, 12].

<div class="outcome-card">
    <h3 class="outcome-card-title">Defendant (Anthropic) wins - Defense successful</h3>
    <div class="outcome-card-content">
        If Anthropic successfully defends against copyright claims, it could support the argument that AI training may qualify as fair use, especially if the court deems the use of copyrighted works transformative [11, 12]. This could encourage other AI companies to utilize copyrighted materials without explicit permission, potentially shifting industry practices on data sourcing [3, 14]. However, it raises concerns about creator compensation, as such a precedent might weaken authors' bargaining power and monetization abilities [2, 19]. Additionally, unresolved legal questions about the legality of using materials from shadow libraries would remain, as the ruling wouldn't clarify the legality of these sources [6, 12]. Furthermore, implications for privacy obligations and data governance in AI training would continue, with companies likely facing scrutiny over data sourcing practices, even after a favorable ruling [4, 17].
